# Phantom

WHAT IS PROJECT Phantom?
Project Phantom allows you to re-experience the original Fortnite, using old game files from all
seasons.
You can host and run your own local server on your PC and even play with friends.

WHY IS MY ANTIVIRUS FLAGGING THE LAUNCHER OR DLL?
The Phantom OG Launcher and DLL files don’t have an certificate, which is why some antivirus
programs may flag them as a virus. This is a false positive and both are safe to use. The DLL is
essential for running Project Phantom OG’s local game server on your PC, and without it, the server
won’t exist, meaning you can't play.

ARE THESE FILES SAFE?
Yes, both the launcher and the DLL are completely safe. The DLL is required to enable certain
features and to run the server locally on your PC. However, because the files aren't signed with a
digital certificate, antivirus software may flag them as threats. Everything has been verified before
pushing any updates and no one had any issues over the past years.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY ANTIVIRUS FLAGS THE FILES?
Whitelist the launcher/DLL: Add both files to your antivirus or firewall’s exclusion list.

Disable your antivirus temporarily during installation, and ensure you’re running the launcher as an administrator.

Download only from trusted sources: Always use links provided in our official Discord

DO I NEED TO CONNECT TO EXTERNAL SERVERS?
No, the DLL is only used to create and run your own local server on your PC. You won’t be
connecting to external servers, making this an entirely local setup
